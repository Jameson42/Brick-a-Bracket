TODO:

- Core service that can be called from hub to submit scores
    - Should probably convert start/stop calls to a service as well?
- Improve device add frontend interface
    - Device type dropdown
    - Connection string options? Can we sense and auto-fill depending on OS? Or at least add help text
    - Device Role - simplify?
    - Program - once device connected, select from available programs on device
- Other tournament types
- Expand Statuses to include source
- Send all statuses to frontend, add toasts to Admin?
- Allow runoffs - bring X results from finished tournament to "sub" tournament
    - Allow derby "Round 2" after all?
- Add help texts to admin screens
- Specialized Primary displays for tournament types
    - "Single Elimination" would benefit from a bracket view
- Add round/match numbers to Secondary match display?
- Authentication to limit admins
- Delete category, round? Regenerate Categories
- Live camera view?
- Record MOC weight
